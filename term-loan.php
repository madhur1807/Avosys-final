                           <ul class="features-ul">
                            <li><p>If the borrower fails to make the repayments, the lender will question the borrower’s liquidity position and the company’s existence will be at stake.</p></li>

                            <li><p>In addition to the collateral security, the borrower will have to tend to the restrictive covenants imposed by the lenders. The borrower will have to close the existing loans and must maintain the asset base and not take another loans. This causes unnecessary interference in the firm’s functioning.</p></li>  
                            <li><p>Since the terms and conditions are negotiable, there is chance that it might affect the interest of the lender.</p></li>
                            <li><p>The lender of term loan will have no control over the company’s affairs and it leads to the lender asking the borrower to convert the loan to equity.</p></li>
