                           <p>The scheme is intended to make short-term working capital finance available to exporters at internationally comparable interest rates.<br><br>Types of Export Credit: (1) Pre-shipment Export Credit/ Packing Credit (RPC/PCFC), (2) Post-shipment Export Credit – both in Foreign Currency (FCY) and Rupees.<br><br>Pre-shipment / Packing Credit also known as 'Packing credit' is a loan/ advance granted to an exporter for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment. Packing credit can also be extended as working capital assistance to meet expenses such as wages, utility payments, travel expenses etc; to companies engaged in export or services. Packing credit is sanctioned/granted on the basis of letter of credit or a confirmed and irrevocable order for the export of goods / services from India or any other evidence of an order for export from India.<br><br>'Post-shipment Credit' means any loan or advance granted or any other credit provided by a bank to an exporter of goods / services from India from the date of extending credit after shipment of goods / rendering of services to the date of realisation of export proceeds as per the period of realization prescribed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and includes any loan or advance granted to an exporter, in consideration of, or on the security of any duty drawback allowed by the Government from time to time. As per extant guidelines of RBI, the period prescribed for realisation of export proceeds is 12 months from the date of shipment.</p>

                           <h2>Bank Guarantee</h2>
                           <p>A bank guarantee is a promise from a bank or other lending institution that if a particular borrower defaults on a loan, the bank will cover the loss. Note that a bank guarantee is not the same as a letter of credit.</p><strong><h5>HOW IT WORKS (EXAMPLE):</h5></strong><p>Let's assume Company XYZ is a small, relatively unknown restaurant company that would like to purchase $3 million of kitchen equipment. The equipment vendor may require Company XYZ to provide a bank guarantee in order to feel more confident that it will receive payment for the equipment it ships to Company XYZ.<br>To obtain this bank guarantee, Company XYZ requests one from its preferred lender (usually the bank with which it keeps its cash accounts). The lender provides the guarantee in writing, which is then passed on to Company XYZ and its vendor. Company XYZ's lender essentially becomes a co-signer on the purchase contract with the vendor.</p><h5>WHY IT MATTERS:</h5><p>A bank guarantee enables companies to make purchases that they would otherwise not be able to make; these guarantees thus serve to heighten business activity and expand entrepreneurial activity.</p>

                           <h2>Buyer's Credit</h2>
                           <p>Buyer credit is a short term credit available to an importer (buyer) from overseas lenders such as banks and other financial institution for goods they are importing. The overseas banks usually lend the importer (buyer) based on the letter of comfort (a bank guarantee) issued by the importer's bank. For this service the importer's bank or buyer's credit consultant charges a fee called an arrangement fee.<br><br>Buyer's credit helps local importers gain access to cheaper foreign funds that may be closer to LIBOR rates as against local sources of funding which are more costly.<br><br>The duration of buyer's credit may vary from country to country, as per the local regulations. For example, in India, buyer's credit can be availed for one year in case the import is for tradeable goods and for three years if the import is for capital goods.</p><h5>BREAKING DOWN 'Buyer's Credit'</h5><p>Buyer’s credit benefits both the seller (exporter) and buyer (importer) in a trade transaction. The exporter is paid in accordance with the terms of the sale contract with the importer, without undue delays. The availability of buyer’s credit also makes it feasible for the exporter to pursue large export orders. The importer obtains the flexibility to pay for the purchases over a period of time, as stipulated in the terms of the buyer’s credit facility, rather than up front at the time of purchase. The importer can also request funding in a major currency that is more stable than the domestic currency, especially if the latter has a significant risk of devaluation.</p><h5>How Does Buyer's Credit Work?</h5><p>The buyer’s credit process typically has the following steps: The exporter enters into a commercial contract with the foreign buyer that specifies the goods or services being supplied, prices, payment terms, etc. The buyer obtains credit from a bank or financial institution to finance the purchase. An export credit agency based in the exporter’s country provides a guarantee to the lending bank covering the risk of default by the buyer. Once the exporter ships the goods, the lending bank pays the exporter as per the terms of the contract with the buyer. The buyer makes principal and interest payments to the lending bank according to the terms of the loan agreement until the loan has been repaid in full.</p>
